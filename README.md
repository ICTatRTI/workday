### What is this repository for? ###

* An IOS questionaire 


### How do I get set up? ###

* You need XCODE 7
* CocoaPods
* Researchnet SDK


Note: The ResearchNet IOS framework can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/rcdrti/researchnetsdk-ios). Some day you will be able to use a dependency manager like Cocopods to bring this in, but until then you'll have to manually like this by dragging the xcodeprj file (from the Finder) into your project then adding this as an embedded binary under the apps General settings.
