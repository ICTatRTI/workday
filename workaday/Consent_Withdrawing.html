<p>The RTI International Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a group of people who independently review research.</p>
<p>The RTI IRB will not be able to answer some study-specific questions, such as questions about appointment times. However, you may contact the RTI IRB if the research staff cannot be reached or if you wish to talk to someone other than the research staff.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH<br /> </strong>Before your data is released to the RTI database, your personal information such as your name, e-mail, etc, will be removed. Your unique code identifier will be used in place of your name when your data is released onto RTI. This de-identified study data will be made available to RTI researchers who have agreed to specific terms and conditions including using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.</p>
<p>Although you can withdraw from the study at any time, you cannot withdraw the de-identified data that have already been distributed through research databases.</p>
<p>The main risk of donating your de-identified data to a centralized database is the potential loss of privacy and confidentiality in case of public disclosure due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes by someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to try to re-identify you. This risk is low.</p>
