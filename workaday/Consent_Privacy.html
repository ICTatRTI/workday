<p><strong>AUTHORIZATION TO USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES</strong></p>
<p>Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in a research study without your written authorization. If you sign this consent form, you will provide that authorization. You do not have to sign this form. But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What personal information will be used or disclosed?</strong></p>
<p>Your personal health information that may be used or disclosed in connection with this research study, will include, but is not limited to your body height, weight, gender, age, ethnicity/race, health history, answers to study questions, and health information that may be discernable from your mobile phone&rsquo;s sensors. Your account information, study data and signed consent form may also be looked at and/or copied by designated personnel for regulatory and quality assurance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who may use and disclose my data? </strong></p>
<p>The study sponsor, investigators, study coordinators and study staff may use and disclose your personal information to do the research described above or as required by law.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who May Receive or Use the Information? The parties listed in the preceding paragraph may disclose your health information as required by law to:</strong></p>
<p></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The RTI International Institutional Review Board who watch over the safety, effectiveness and conduct of the research,</li>
<li>Others, if the law requires</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>We will not disclose your identity in any reports about this study such as scientific publications or presentations.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>When will my authorization expire? Your authorization for the use and/or disclosure of your health information will expire if you choose to withdraw from the research study.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protect your privacy. Your identity will be kept as confidential as possible. Except as required by law, you will not be identified by name or by any other direct personal identifier.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy we will use a random code number instead of your name on all your data collected, analyzed, aggregated and released to researchers. Information about the code will be kept in a secure system. Researchers will have access to all the data collected in the study, but will be unable to easily map any particular data to the identities of the participants.</p>
<p>The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or medical meetings or published in scientific journals. However, your identity will not be disclosed. Patient information may be provided to Federal and other regulatory agencies as required. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, may inspect research records and learn your identity if this study falls within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This study anticipates that your de-identified data will be placed in a &ldquo;repository&rdquo; - an online database &ndash; where qualified researchers can access it. Your data will be included into large, computational studies related to general health and wellness. There is always a risk that the database can be breached by hackers, or that experts in re-identification may attempt to reverse our processes. Total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>COMPENSATION FOR INJURY</strong></p>
<p>THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION, HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE TO PARTICIPANTS.</p>
<p>If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator and the research study staff will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your insurance.</p>
<p>If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance, managed care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. The sponsor will not routinely pay charges that your insurance does not cover. No payment is routinely available from the study sponsor.</p>
