<p><strong>PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p><strong>What will you be asked to do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Download a mobile app (free) and register an account: </strong>You need to have the study app on your phone in order to participate in this study. Everyone who enrolls will first complete an electronic registration process. Registration will include entering your name, email address and other general information about yourself. As part of this process you will also confirm your agreement to participate in the study.</li>

<li><strong>Submit daily reports</strong>: We will ask you to complete very brief, daily surveys describing how you feel and a question about excercise</li>
<li><strong>Allow continuous passive tracking of your location and physical activity</strong>: We will ask all participants to enable the capture of continuous spatial data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor on your mobile phone. In addition, we will track your movement, including physical activity and time in transit, through the accelerometer sensor on your mobile phone. You may choose to not to participate in this study if you do not wish to submit to this level of tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The surveys should take you about 1 minute each day.  We will send notifications on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys. You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) </p>
<p><strong>What we will and will not do with the data?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to protect your privacy, we take all reasonable  precautions to transmit and store your data securley</li>
<li>However, we cannot guarantee that all data can remain anonymous forever.</li>
<li>Researchers will have the ability to contact you if you have chosen to allow them to do so.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES</strong></p>
<p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful thought.</p>
<p>This is an observation study not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from participating.</p>

<p>Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel self-conscious. You can avoid that by putting a passcode on your phone to block unauthorized users from accessing your phone content.</p>
<p>Be safe &ndash; just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform tasks!</p>
<p>You may have concerns about data security, privacy and confidentiality. We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of confidentiality. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can <u>directly</u> identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual given enough cross-referenced information about him or her. This risk, while very low, should still be contemplated prior to enrolling.</p>
<p>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan. You can respond to the surveys via the web portal instead of via your mobile phone but all the tasks must be completed using your mobile phone.</p>
<p>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time.</p>
<p>You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.</p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this study is to create knowledge, which can benefits us as a society. The benefits are primarily the creation of insights to help current and future patients and their families to better detect, understand and manage their health. We will return the insights learned from analysis of the study data to you by sending notifications to the mobile application as those insights are validated. But these insights may not be of direct benefit to you. We cannot, and thus we do not, guarantee or promise that you will personally receive any direct benefits from this study.</p>
<p><strong>COSTS</strong></p>
<p>There is no cost to you to participate in this study other than to your mobile data plan if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong></p>
<p>Since no medical treatments are provided during this study there are no alternative therapies. The only alternative is to not participate.</p>
